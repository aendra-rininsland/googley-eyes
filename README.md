# Googley Eyes

## WARNING: This isn't working yet, there is nothing here. This message will be removed once there is!

## What is it?

Googley Eyes is a project to try and port IBM's [ManyEyes](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/) 
project to a chart format usable with Google Spreadsheet. 

## Why Google Spreadsheets?

Google Spreadsheets are widely used, with their charts easily embeddable in web
documents. I felt this would be the most accessible way to use these charts,
with the Google Spreadsheet providing the data importing/outputting functionality
that ManyEyes itself enabled.

## What if I **don't** want to use these with Google Spreadsheets?

I have another project, [d3Eyes](http://www.github.com/aendrew/D3Eyes), that seeks
to redo most of ManyEyes charts with d3.js. That may be more appropriate for some
projects -- give it a look!

## What charts are already working?

Nothing yet! Check back later, or better yet, contribute one yourself!

## What charts are planned?

The following [ManyEyes visualizations](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/page/Visualization_Options.html) will be added (in order of implementation):

1. [Block histogram](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/page/Block_Histogram.html)
1. [Treemap/Treemap for comparisons](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/page/Treemap.html)
1. [Word Tree](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/page/Word_Tree.html)
1. [Phrase Net](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/page/Phrase_Net.html)
1. [Matrix chart](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/page/Phrase_Net.html)
1. [Stack Graph for Categories](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/page/Stack_Graph_for_Categories.html)
1. [Map-based visualizations (Via Google Maps)](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/page/World_Map.html)

This order reflects my own personal (admittedly selfish) priorities for these visualizations.
However, I can probably be convinced to bump up priority for a particular
visualization if an individual or organization is willing to sponsor it. Please
[contact me](mailto:aendrew@aendrew.com) for more details.

## Why aren't you implementing word cloud/bar chart/bubble chart/etc.?

Google Spreadsheets and ManyEyes share many of the same charts. The native
Google ones will always be better supported (and are already built!), so unless
there's a really good reason for me to do so, I'm not going to re-implement them.

(Exception to this are word/tag clouds -- they're the mullets of visualization.)

## Who are you, exactly?

I'm [Ændrew Rininsland](http://www.aendrew.com), a free data journalist and 
news nerd always looking for new and interesting ways to visualize information. 
I took on this project because I was taught to use ManyEyes in [journalism school](http://www.city.ac.uk)
but have always hated Java as a client-side rendering technology (Burn it with fire!).  

I've done work for [The Economist](http://www.economist.com), [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk), 
[DataDrivenJournalism.net](http://DataDrivenJournalism.net), the [Hackney Citizen](http://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk),
the [Calgary Herald](http://www.calgaryherald.com) and started my journalism career at [The Gauntlet](http://www.thegauntlet.ca).

I also do development and consultancy for [Graphic Alliance](http://www.graphicalliance.co.uk) and [Beauchamp Creative](http://www.beauchampcreative.ca).
